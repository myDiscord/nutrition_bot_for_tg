The bot calculates the daily calorie intake. 
All calculations are made according to the Harris-Benedict equation. 
Harris-Benedict principle is a method used to estimate an individual's basal 
metabolic rate (BMR).
The estimated BMR value may be multiplied by a number that corresponds 
to the individual's activity level; the resulting number is the approximate daily 
kilocalorie intake to maintain current body weight.
The Harris-Benedict equation may be used to assist weight loss.

Note that the Harris-Benedict formula cannot be apply to very obese people 
(the formula overestimates their actual caloric needs) and very muscular 
people (the formula underestimates their actual needs). The formula can be 
used to calculate calories for persons over 18 years of age. However, 
the calculations using the Harris-Benedict equation are an excellent starting 
point, its performance can form the basis of an effective and balanced diet, 
it allows you to assess your energy needs, to review and adjust the diet in 
order to ultimately achieve those parameters that everyone considers for to 
be as acceptable as possible.
